31|1|1|Five distinct ester hydrolases (EC 3-1) have been characterized in guinea-pig epidermis.
31|1|2|These are carboxylic esterase, acid phosphatase, pyrophosphatase, and arylsulphatase A and B.
31|1|3|Their properties are consistent with those of lysosomal enzymes.
32|1|1|A serum agglutinin reactive with red cells in the presence of polycarboxyl groups is reported.
32|1|2|It is likely that this represents an additional example of the type of agglutinin previously described as agglutinating red cells in the absence of ionized calcium.
32|1|3|Experimental evidence is presented indicating that it is free polycarboxyl groups that potentiate agglutination and that any metal ion, such as calcium, capable of chelating with these groups will prove to be inhibitory.
33|1|1|Stroma from either normal or PNH-like red cells is capable of inhibiting, to some extent, lysis in the sucrose test and enhancing lysis in the acidified-serum test.
33|1|2|The same opposing effects are displayed by the exclusion peaks from Sephadex G-200 obtained from each stroma preparation, suggesting that the same factor could be responsible for both activities.
33|1|3|Stromata and peaks also induce lysis of PNH-like cells in unacidified serum, indicating activation of complement through the alternate pathway.
33|1|4|This is confirmed by immunoelectrophoretic observation.
33|1|5|When serum previously activated through the alternate pathway is used in the sucrose test the amount of lysis is markedly reduced.
33|1|6|This would indicate that the classical pathway activation can be controlled by the alternate pathway.
33|1|7|The possible clinical significance of these factors in determining the haemolytic crisis in PNH patients is discussed.
35|1|1|The effect of the major metabolite of aspirin, namely salicylic acid, upon the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) of normal and G6PD-deficient red cells has been studied.
35|1|2|Salicylic acid was shown to inhibit this pathway in proportion to the amount present.
35|1|3|At any concentration of this substance there was greater inhibition of the PPP in G6PD-deficient than in normal red cells.
36|1|1|1.
36|1|2|In one experiment the effect on rumen pH of feeding with restricted amounts of whole or pelleted barley was studied.
36|1|3|With whole barley there was little variation in rumen pH associated with feeding time, but with pelleted barley the pH decreased from about 7-0 before feeding to about 5-3, 2--3 h after feeding.
36|1|4|2.
36|1|5|The rate of disappearance of dried grass during incubation in the rumens of sheep receiving either whole or pelleted barley was studied in a second experiment.
36|1|6|After 24 h incubation only 423 mg/g incubated had disappeared in the rumen of sheep receiving pelleted barley while 625 mg/g incubated had disappeared when it was incubated in the rumen of sheep receiving whole barley.
36|1|7|3.
36|1|8|The voluntary intake of dried grass of lambs was studied in a third experiment when they received supplements of either 25 or 50 g whole or pelleted barley/kg live weight 0-75.
36|1|9|At the high level, pelleted barley reduced intake of dried grass by 534 g/kg but whole barley reduced it by only 352 g/kg.
36|1|10|The digestibility of acid-detergent fibre was reduced more by pelleted barley than by whole barley but there was a tendency for a small increase in digestibility of the barley due to processing.
36|1|11|4.
36|1|12|The implications of these findings on supplementation of roughages with cereals are discussed.
37|1|1|Poly(8-aminoguanylic acid) has in neutral solution a novel ordered structure of high stability.
37|1|2|The 8-amino group permits formation of three hydrogen bonds between two residues along the "top", or long axis, of the purines.
37|1|3|The usual hydrogen bonding protons and Watson-Crick pairing sites are not involved in the association.
37|1|4|The bonding scheme has a twofold rotation axis and is hemiprotonated at N(7).
37|1|5|Poly(8NH2G) is converted by alkaline titration (pK = 9.7) to a quite different ordered structure, which is the favored form over the range approximately pH 10-11.
37|1|6|The bonding scheme appears to be composed of a planar, tetrameric array of guanine residues, in which the 8-amino group does not participate in interbase hydrogen bonding.
37|1|7|Poly (8NH2G) does not interact with poly(C) in neutral solution because of the high stability of the hemiprotonated G-G self-structure.
37|1|8|Titration to the alkaline plateau, however, permits ready formation of a two-stranded Watson-Crick helix.
37|1|9|In contrast to the monomer 8NH2GMP, poly(8NH2G) does not form a triple helix with poly(C) under any conditions.
37|1|10|The properties of the ordered structures are interpreted in terms of a strong tendency of the 8-amino group to form a third interbase hydrogen bond, when this possibility is not prevented by high pH.
38|1|1|The presence of at least two ionizable active center groups has been detected by a study of the effect of pH upon catalysis of hydrolysis of L-alanyl-beta-naphthylamide by human liver alanine aminopeptidase and upon the inhibition of hydrolysis by inhibitors and substrate analogs.
38|1|2|Octanoic acid, octylamine, and peptide inhibitors have been found to be competitive inhibitors and are therefore thought to bind the active center.
38|1|3|L-Phe was previously shown to bind the active center since it was found to be a competitive inhibitor of the hydrolysis of tripeptide substrates (Garner, C. W., and Behal, F. J. (1975), Biochemistry 14, 3208).
38|1|4|A plot of pKm vs. pH for the substrate L-Ala-beta-naphthylamide showed that binding decreased below pH 5.9 and above 7.5, the points at which the theoretical curve undergoes an integral change in slope.
38|1|5|These points are interpreted as the pKa either of substrate ionizable groups or binding-dependent enzyme active center groups.
38|1|6|Similar plots of pKm vs. pH for L-alanyl-p-nitroanilide (as substrate) and pKi vs. pH for L-Leu-L-Leu-L-Leu and D-Leu-L-Tyr (as inhibitors) gave pairs fo pKa values of 5.8 and 7.4, 6.0 and 7.5, and 5.7 and 7.5, respectively.
38|1|7|All the above substrates (and D-Leu-L-Tyr) have pKa values near 7.5; therefore, the binding-dependent group with a pKa value near 7.5 is possibly this substrate group.
38|1|8|Similar plots of pKi vs. pH for the inhibitors L-Phe, L-Met, L-Leu, octylamine, and octanoic acid had only one bending point at 7.7, 7.6, 7.4, 6.3, and 5.9, respectively.
38|1|9|Amino acid inhibitors, octylamine, and octanoic acid have no groups with pKa values between 5 and 9.
38|1|10|These data indicate that there are two active center ionizable groups with pKa values of approximately 6.0 and 7.5 which are involved in substrate binding or inhibitory amino acid binding but not in catalysis since Vmax was constant at all pH values tested.
39|1|1|The reaction of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate (gl) with NAD+ and NADP+ has been studied with stopped-flow techniques.
39|1|2|The enzyme was in all experiments present in excess of the coenzyme.
39|1|3|The results indicate that the ternary complex (E-NAD(P)H-kg) is present as an intermediate in the formation of the stable complex (E-NAD(P)H-gl).
39|1|4|The identification of the complexes is based on their absorption spectra.
39|1|5|The binding of the coenzyme to (E-gl) is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) while the dissociation of alpha-ketoglutarate (kg) from this complex is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl).
39|1|6|The Km for glutamate was 20-25 mM in the first reaction and 3 mM in the formation of the stable complex.
39|1|7|The Km values were independent of the coenzyme.
39|1|8|The reaction rates with NAD+ were approximately 50% greater than those with NADP+.
39|1|9|Furthermore, high glutamate concentration inhibited the formation of (E-NADH-kg) while no substrate inhibition was found with NADP+ as coenzyme.
39|1|10|ADP enhanced while GTP reduced the rate of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) formation.
39|1|11|The rate of formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) was inhibited by ADP, while it increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of GTP were added.
39|1|12|The results show that the higher activity found with NAD+ compared to NADP+ under steady-state assay conditions do not necessarily involve binding of NAD+ to the ADP activating site of the enzyme.
39|1|13|Moreover, the substrate inhibition found at high glutamate concentration under steady-state assay condition is not due to the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) as this complex is formed with Km of 3 mM glutamate, and the substrate inhibition is only significant at 20-30 times this concentration.
40|1|1|Choline acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6) catalyzes the biosynthesis of acetylcholine according to the following chemical equation: acetyl-CoA + choline in equilibrium to acetylcholine + CoA.
40|1|2|In addition to nervous tissue, primate placenta is the only other animal source which contains appreciable acetylcholine and its biosynthetic enzyme.
40|1|3|Human brain caudate nucleus and human placental choline acetyltransferase were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using ion-exchange and blue dextran-Sepharose affinity chromatography.
40|1|4|The molecular weights determined by Sephadex G-150 gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis are 67000 plus or minus 3000.
40|1|5|N-Ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) inhibit the enzyme.
40|1|6|Dithiothreitol reverses the inhibition produced by the latter two reagents.
40|1|7|The pKa of the group associated with N-ethylmaleimide inhibition is 8.6 plus or minus 0.3.
40|1|8|A chemically competent acetyl-thioenzyme is isolable by Sephadex gel filtration.
40|1|9|The enzymes from the brain and placenta are thus far physically and biochemically indistinguishable.
